## Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson
#### _Author : @IBM Academy_

## Information Project üîé
In this guided project, i learn how to build my own AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, my personal assistant will use voice. 
i will use Watson Speech-to-Text to give my AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that my assistant can read the answers back to me.

With a voice-based personal assistant at my beck and call, i will be able to get answers, find information, and even have conversations, all without lifting a finger.
